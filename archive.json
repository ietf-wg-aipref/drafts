For instance, taking written text and asking for a summary.\n\nSomething @lrosenthol said during the meeting seemed right to me.  We can have the definition include prohibitions (or reservations, or the opposite) for inferences of all those types, but then leave the question as to whether different parts of the system respect that to the people who are building those elements.  And their lawyers.\n\nOne possible response is to respect opt-outs and refuse to process inputs.  For instance, it could be that copying of style is not something that a particular product wants to be associated with.\n\nAnother approach is to ask the user of the system to accept the responsibility for contravening expressed preferences.  That might manifest in a number of ways from implicit/invisible (terms of service that make users responsible for respecting preferences for the content they source) to very prominent (an active prompt when using content that has preferences not to allow inference that forces users to accept that).\n\nRAG systems where automated systems seek out and ingest content probably have a different set of constraints on what they can or cannot do.  Still, the suite of options available for people building those products are still roughly along the same lines.\n\nEither way, this is not necessarily something that we have to decide here.  It's worth understanding, for sure, so that we are sure that the set of possibilities we enable are acceptable.  I am personally comfortable with that.",

Under the EU AI Act, AI model developers will mostly demonstrate compliance by signing up to a Code of Practice, which is currently being finalized. The latest draft version of the Code of Practice requires AI developers to: \r\n\r\n\"(a) employ web-crawlers that read and follow instructions expressed in accordance with the\r\nRobot Exclusion Protocol (robots.txt), as specified in the Internet Engineering Task Force\r\n(IETF) Request for Comments No. 9309, and any subsequent version of this IETF standard,\r\nand\r\n(b) make best efforts to identify and comply with other appropriate machine-readable protocols\r\nto express rights reservations pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/790, for\r\nexample through asset-based or location-based metadata\u201c\r\n\r\nIn other words, while the preference signals are voluntary, they may very well end up having a quasi-mandatory effect on AI developers through the AI Act Code of Practice. Users won\u2019t have the option to simply switch to another provider if the vocabulary requires AI companies that want to \u201eread and follow\u201c or \u201eidentify and comply with\" the preference signals to restrict actions of their users that are perfectly legal under copyright law.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why it is very important, if we don\u2019t want the preference signals to inadvertently become a mechanism for technologically depriving end users of their rights under copyright law (such as the right to private copying, parody etc.), the vocabulary has to define the actions of end users interacting with AI tools as out of scope.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nFelix\r\n\r\n> Am 25.06.2025 um 12:23 schrieb Paul Keller ***@***.***>:\r\n> \r\n> To me, it is pretty clear that at this stage, we have two lines of argument related to the question of how we can prevent preferences about inference from impacting individual users\u2019 rights, that we will need to resolve at some point (in London, I assume).\r\n> \r\n> The first one goes for a broad definition of inference (use of an asset as input for a trained model) and assumes that the protection of users\u2019 rights can best be left to implementers / the market (if a tool interprets preference signals very restrictively, then just use another tool that does not).

The example about the Code of Practice indicates that governments (not this group) can and will do whatever they want to shape rules which govern the use of content - and I think it is in those forums that these discussions should happen to address concerns about how far those rules go.

I'll take as examples the request for an image description or the simplification of a complex paragraph for somebody with an intellectual disability. \n\nIt is true that in this first variant, a user providing a document to an AI system and prompting \"copy it with a few differences\" is going against the will of the content owner. However, I imagine that anti-parasitism and anti-counterfeit laws would apply if he publicly releases the results of this process. \n\nI'm therefore not comfortable with an AI preference that can easily clash with accessibility requirements (especially if some system developers poorly understand the nuance). \n\nIn the second variant, the content possibly flagged with an opt-out is provided by the system as part of the RESPONSE offered by the AI system. This is typically the RAG case, where fresh content is combined with a trained model to improve the response. The AI system is responsible for the content it selects, there is no clash with pro-accessibility laws, and the AI preferences are therefore easy to apply. \n\nNobody knows how long the term RAG will survive before a new method appears.

I heard that most restrictive was perhaps the safest approach, but there are some potential secondary information channels that might lead to weighting things differently.  For instance, an HTTP header field might be considered as an override for something in robots.txt rather than having both preferences apply.\n\nThings to consider also are the specificity associated with different channels.  If both HTTP header field and robots.txt apply and we go with most specific, most restrictive (in that order) then a more specific \"allow\" statement in robots.txt would override a less specific \"deny\" statement in the header field.  That might be surprising to the entity specifying the \"deny\" preference.

This vocabulary allows for the creation of structured declarations about restrictions or permissions for use of digital assets by such systems.\n\n\"Content\" does like a straight-forward term to use here.

A *thing* that is reproduced from an original (a digital scan of the Mona Lisa, say) is no different from an image that was wholly digital at its inception.  The subject of the preference is the sequence of bits, maybe with its metadata.\n\nI don't agree with Leonard that \"artifact\" implies secondary.  From my visits to museums, the use of the word in that context seems pretty clearly applicable to primary instances.  But then, perhaps all digital things being secondary is something we can embrace, rather than consider to be a failing of sorts.  That there can be no \"primary\" instance is a delightful idea to me.\n\n> the ATTACH draft already uses it in the title\n\nI would not consider that as a reason to use \"Content\".  Though I do regard it positively, despite the negative connotations.  To Paul's point, In my industry \"user\" has negative connotations as it can have a dehumanizing impact; it's still a term of art though.

For instance, on-list discussion seems to be moving toward the idea of having an IANA registry for the vocabulary.  If that holds, we'll need to add something for that.\n\nThen there are extensions that are not limited to the vocabulary.  If we go with #26, that might be non-vocabulary dictionary keys or parameters on those keys (which might be specific to different vocabulary terms).\n\nMy proposal is to define clearly how to extend the vocabulary and define an IANA registry for that.  But leave other forms of extension open in a way that would require a fresh RFC to define.\n\nI would suggest that the vocabulary registry operate on a fairly strict regime, not because of a scarcity of space, but to signal that we think that new categories should be discouraged generally.  We can't completely cut that off: experience with registries shows that if you are too strict, people don't bother with registration, instead they just use whatever codepoints they like without any coordination.  Such things lead to interoperability failure and can make things very unhealthy.  I'd probably suggest that we pick one of the [RFC 8126](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8126#section-4) options that looks permissive, but add instructions that strongly discourage registration in practice.

As our friends in search are happy to remind us: search _is_ an AI application, so attempting to distinguish between \"search\" and \"AI search\" is essentially meaningless.

It's possible this was discussed at the meetings and I'm missing some context, but it seems like carving out \"Search\" will have an inevitable effect of applications contorting themselves to be Search-oriented for the likely outcome of more permissive preferences.\n\nFor example, suppose a content owner does not want to be de-listed from all modern search the utilizes AI for the \"core search\" technology. They do not however want to consent to say, a chatbot-like application which is going to perform a \"deep research\" style feature that produces an extended report with a citation to the source. The existing definition carve out simply says:\n\n> Using one or more assets in a search application that directs users to the location from which the assets were retrieved.\n\nIt is pretty easy to suggest any linking to the original content \"directs the user to the location\". This can go beyond text too, for example, suppose a hypothetical product which produces a short form video or podcast based on a research topic. As part of the media output, it produces URLs linking to the source material. The application can claim this is \"directing the user to that location\".\n\nI'm not sure there's any viable way around this beyond getting more specific about the particular application experiences, or, alternatively, not having carve-outs at all. If the former, there likely needs to be more specific taxonomy for application use cases, that likely evolve over time.",

      "body": "### Confirmation\n\n- [x] I have reviewed our [existing WLGC issues](https://github.com/ietf-wg-aipref/drafts/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Awglc) and this issue is not present there.\n- [x] I have read and understand the [IETF NOTE WELL](https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/).\n\n### Issue Description\n\nBuilding on the note I sent to the Working Group on August 4th, and in reaction to the WGLC, I\u2019m opening this issue to explain our concerns. Most importantly, I\u2019m also attaching a display-based preferences vocabulary proposal as a path forward under the solution  text box. \nAs I and others have stressed, a vocabulary should achieve clarity, able to be adopted, and align with technical realities. Based on careful analysis, the current vocabulary draft (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-aipref-vocab-03) does not achieve these aims. I appreciate the input and effort directed towards the draft, including updates to rework certain terms. However, I think key structural issues remain. \n\nI propose that we prioritize display-based preferences instead, which are clearer, enforceable, and better aligned with Search/AI user and publisher expectations. \n\nBefore I explain why a **display-based preferences vocabulary** approach is preferrable, I want to take a moment to unpack several of the structural challenges with the current draft. \n\n**Automated Processing category risks jeopardizing a safe and working internet**\nThe \u201cautomated processing\u201d category even as currently defined is **too broad and vague** to be actionable. It covers any use of content on a modern computing device \u2013 including when we export a document to PDF, print a file, or view pages in a browser. As Greg noted on the working group email, \u201cI imagine that running code on html to extract outgoing links is \u2018automated processing\u2019 [quotes in original]. Therefore, no crawler, even crawlers totally unrelated to AI, could function in such a world.\u201d Our concern is that this category places the larger Internet at risk of being less safe and usable for everyone as this category encompasses:\n\n\u2022\t**Content moderation and filtering** - critical for content safety.\n\u2022\t**Spam/Junk/High risk content tagging** \u2013 critical to operating the Internet safely.\n\u2022\t**Accessibility features** - such as automated captions and layout adjustments.\n\nHere too, we acknowledge that these outcomes are not the intended desire, yet the fact remains that this category risks disabling essential functionality, creating false assurances for users, and introducing complaints against implementers - especially in regulated environments.  It also deserves mention that existing controls allow web publishers to express a preference about whether a bot/crawler can access the site at all. We should focus our attention on those terms if there are issues with their adoption or application; information I have not heard expressed in this working group. \n\n**The \u201cSearch\u201d Category Presents a Host of Problems**\nNotwithstanding the rationale for why \u201cSearch\u201d was introduced into this document, for most webmasters and site owners, \u201cSearch\u201d is a generally well understood system. The introduction of a well-known term in a vague context like \u201cai preferences\u201d disrupts and confuses the larger ecosystem as opposed to adding value (or, to assuage publisher concerns in light of a display-based approach). Let me explain further:\n\n**1. Search and AI are converging**\nThere is an increasingly clear trend to converge search interfaces with AI interfaces, and the user experiences will become even more indistinguishable.\n\n**2. Technically Incoherent**\nModern search systems - whether traditional or AI-enhanced - are deeply integrated with AI technologies for ranking, snippet generation, and relevance modeling. Attempting to isolate \u201csearch\u201d as a distinct opt-out category creates a false dichotomy between AI and non-AI search. This distinction is not technically meaningful and cannot be reliably enforced.\n\n**3. Operationally Unenforceable**\nUnlike display preferences (e.g., \u201cno snippet\u201d), the \u201csearch\u201d category attempts to regulate internal system behavior via some vague notion of \u201cdirects users to the location from which the assets were retrieved\u201d (note the web is full of content redirects). This introduces enforcement challenges: the boundaries of \u201csearch\u201d are undefined and invisible to users, making it difficult to audit whether a system has respected a \u201csearch\u201d opt-out.\n\n**4. Redundant with Existing Mechanisms**\nSite owners already have very many tools like robots.txt, noindex, and structured data to control search indexing and display. The \u201csearch\u201d category duplicates these controls without offering additional clarity or functionality. Worse, it risks conflicting with existing standards and creating confusion for implementers.\n\n\n### Proposed Resolution\n\n**Why Display Preferences Provide a Better Alternative**\n\n**1. Observable and Enforceable**\nDisplay-based preferences focus on how content is shown, not how it is processed behind the scenes. They are testable and auditable, making them far more suitable for a standards-based vocabulary.\n\n**2. Aligned with User Expectations**\nIn our experience, content owners are primarily concerned about how their content appears. Preferences such as, \u201cno index\u201d, \u201cno snippet\u201d or \u201cmax snippet length\u201d reflect real-world concerns and are already supported by major platforms.\n\n**3. Clearer language Allows for Harmonized Adoption** \nVague categories like \u201csearch\u201d or \u201cAI Training\u201d vs \u201cGenerative AI Training\u201d introduce ambiguities that plague a harmonized adoption of these preferences. This sets up future disputes between parties and undermines the credibility of the standard.\n\n**4. Supporting Content Subscription scenarios**\nIn our experience, some content, as paywall content, can have difference level of presentation. Whole document can be accessed for ranking but only some of it can be presented.\n\n**Proposal for change \u2013 display-based preferences**\nOur proposal introduces the concept of display-based preferences, which control (allow, disallow, or limit) the presentation of content collected by web and AI crawlers. These include vocabulary terms on access, indexing and retrieval, text display, text length limits, exact text match, image preview, video preview, and generative AI training. Importantly, each category corresponds to specific usage controls often reflected in existing web standards. This allows the working group to inherit and build off experiences and familiarity.\n\nThis display-based preferences vocabulary also offers control for display/prevention of content in all experiences powered by this content collected, not only web-based experiences and API results. Its offer control for LLM built from the content collected also.\n\n[\\[IETF Issue File\\] A Vocabulary For Expressing Access and Usage of Assets by Search and AI crawlers_Clean_v3.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22183722/IETF.Issue.File.A.Vocabulary.For.Expressing.Access.and.Usage.of.Assets.by.Search.and.AI.crawlers_Clean_v3.pdf)",

(You also argue against having this category, so I want to clarify this in particular.)\n* Removal of the search category.\n* Introduction of replacement controls on display.

The proposal does say that these \"apply independently of each other\". You explicitly change the \"MUST NOT\" regarding the definition of supersets into a \"MAY\", which implies that a hierarchy might exist, but none of your items is hierarchical.  But you also talk about combination and having the most restrictive apply.  It might help to expand on that a little.\n* Can you explain how you think that \"Exact text match\" should work?  I don't understand how you would identify what text would need to be quoted as-is from a larger article.  I wasn't able to work out what you meant from the SF Chronicle example either.\n* I'm not clear on whether you believe the statements people might make using this proposed vocabulary to be preferences in the sense that they might be ignored.  I can't tell whether the removal of the text on that was for brevity (as you do with boilerplate) or to make a specific point.  It seems like the goal is to make compliance with each of the proposed \"directives\" is now measurable, which might argue for something stricter.\n\nOne thing that might help people understand this better is to walk through a couple of scenarios and see how the new approach might affect a different outcome.

We've also talked about a few things including how this might affect a generative image creation tool for style or composition mimickry.  I understand that that's more words, which can distract from a core message, but it's potentially useful supplemental material that will help illustrate utility.  \n\nFinally, I want to understand how you see the proposal better at a high level.  Should I look at this as a single change that has to be taken in its entirety or not at all?  Or, are each of the above targeted changes things that you could argue for independently, such that we could break this down and discuss each in turn?\n\nObviously, breaking things down might make organizing discussion easier, but that only makes sense if there isn't an overarching principle that might motivate making all the changes together.  It seems like you are seeking to articulate a principle at a higher level, but I'm struggling to grasp it.  I don't know if that is what you are getting at with the concept of \"display-based preferences\", which I admit I had a lot of trouble with.  Maybe it's a search thing I should be familiar with, but missed.  Is there a framing you would use for the current drafts that I could use as a point of comparison that would help me better contrast the approaches? Or something else that might help me internalize this \"display-based preference\" concept?",

          "body": "> Thanks for sharing this.\n@martinthomson - I really appreciate the time you took to ask such thoughtful and insightful questions. Please find my responses below.\n\n> * Removal of the top-level category.\n**Response:**We believe that the Automated Processing category is too broad and vague and will lead to a less safe and less open Internet in the long run.\n\n> * Removal of the AI training category.\n**Response:** This category is unnecessary and inclusion of this will reduce capability for very many simple operations that we may undertake ranging from spam/junk detection to translation. However, we did not fully remove the category. It appears in a limited focused form in the Gen AI category below. \n\n> * Keeping the generative AI category.  (You also argue against having this category, so I want to clarify this in particular.)\n**Response:** We are supportive of keeping this category as its own category. It should not be nested and can be meaningful on its own. \n\n> * Removal of the search category.\n**Response:** We believe the Search category was added to offset the harm created by the Automated Processing and AI Training categories \u2013 along with the hierarchical structure into which its lumped. Search is well established and is already well-supported in RFC 9309\u2013 there is absolutely no reason to create confusion and disrupt the ecosystem with a new way to opt in or out \u2013 over current mechanisms which have served everyone well for decades. \n\n> * Introduction of replacement controls on display.  If I understand this correctly, these are essentially the same controls that are respected by Bing and (maybe) other search engines (documented [here](https://www.bing.com/webmasters/help/which-robots-metatags-does-bing-support-5198d240)).\n**Response:** This is not about Bing or any other AI provider. Display-based preferences vocabulary allows for way more elegance and engineering parsimony than any of the definitions currently under consideration. Search and AI interfaces are converging. As technology evolves and users become more familiar with AI, the boundaries between these interfaces will continue to converge, Therefore, the goal is to provide a greater degree of control to users and content owners \u2013 without getting mired in a definition and hierarchy debate \u2013 which has caused severe lack of rough consensus around the current draft. \n\n> I'm unclear on a few things:\n\n> * Whether this proposes not having the hierarchical structure we have in the present draft or not.  The proposal does say that these \"apply independently of each other\". You explicitly change the \"MUST NOT\" regarding the definition of supersets into a \"MAY\", which implies that a hierarchy might exist, but none of your items is hierarchical.  But you also talk about combination and having the most restrictive apply.  It might help to expand on that a little.\n**Response:** We believe that hierarchy is unnecessary and not an elegant engineering solution. What the hierarchical structure has done is introduce unnecessary need for more patchwork like suggestions, definitions, and vocabulary proposal which in the end do not address the concerns of the larger ecosystem. We are happy to use whatever language to communicate this with the understanding that Search and AI are synonymous in experience. We do believe that if all or some of the preferences are present simultaneously - there is indeed a logic to break any ties in preference expression that should be considered as part of the attachment mechanism with priority towards the most restrictive preference. Please note that I have provided an example to show how layering is possible without a hierarchy in the vocabulary itself in response to a question below. \n\n> * Can you explain how you think that \"Exact text match\" should work?  I don't understand how you would identify what text would need to be quoted as-is from a larger article.  I wasn't able to work out what you meant from the SF Chronicle example either.\n**Response:** The \u201cexact text match\u201d category expresses a preference that limits the use of the indicated text content in any outputs to match exactly the source from which that text was retrieved for that instance. It addresses multiple concerns that content owners have expressed and offers much more control in an elegant way. We did not talk at all about the attachment mechanism in our proposal. However, \u201cexact text match\u201d is an elegant engineering solution that does not get into unnecessary issues of how AI ops and workflows are implemented in the background and simply treats the issues that users and content owners raise. We are happy to propose an appropriate attachment mechanism. Furthermore, the request to not transform text, verbs, sentences was expressed by various persons in IETF meetings including Matt Rogerson. Second, existing technology which has not yet been optimized for such restrictions is already able to deliver such summarized view of documents, detecting the dominant key sentences listed in the document. Please try in your favorite AI solution the following: \u201c_Generate a summary from <URL> quoting only key sentences of the document._\u201d \n\n> * I'm not clear on whether you believe the statements people might make using this proposed vocabulary to be preferences in the sense that they might be ignored.  I can't tell whether the removal of the text on that was for brevity (as you do with boilerplate) or to make a specific point.  It seems like the goal is to make compliance with each of the proposed \"directives\" is now measurable, which might argue for something stricter.\n**Response:** We intend for our proposal to be included into the context of the current drafts \u2013 not totally usurp it. We understand these are preferences \u2013 but, we prefer to use a display-based preference. We did not have a better way to provide a focused proposal in response to the WGLC. So \u2013 this is just for logistics and keeping the focus on our display-based preferences vocabulary.  \n\n> One thing that might help people understand this better is to walk through a couple of scenarios and see how the new approach might affect a different outcome. I certainly found the examples you included in the appendix to be helpful, but they seemed somewhat search-centric and they were somewhat mechanical (that might be the point, in which case it would be good to confirm that).\n**Response:** We welcome the opportunity to present additional scenarios and intend to share - leading up to Zurich. We appreciate that our experience with these and similar controls stems from significant background in operating a search engine, yet these controls apply more broadly. The definitions do not include a restriction to Search or some other experience. The examples tease out what we think are the use cases that have been subject to much debate over the last several months \u2013 namely, how publisher content is presented, irrespective of the interface. We do not see search and AI as distinct. Search is AI and the experiences are not distinguishable. \n\n> The hot question of the moment seems to be how AI overviews might be affected; answering that would be helpful. We've also talked about a few things including how this might affect a generative image creation tool for style or composition mimickry. I understand that that's more words, which can distract from a core message, but it's potentially useful supplemental material that will help illustrate utility.\n**Response:** While this debate may look hot today \u2013 this is too specific to one form of many such experiences. The \u201cExact text match\u201d category is clearly one way to ensure the content is not changed and presented as a summarization. This coupled with \u201cdisplay length\u201d can provide an elegant solution.\ufffc Please also note that there are current very well-known options such as \u201c_data-nosnippet\u201d_ that clearly offer another elegant way of dealing with this scenario \u2013 particularly in the context of content that may be partially paywalled. It is common practice to enclose such content using the \u201c_data-nosnippet_\u201d option. \n\n> Finally, I want to understand how you see the proposal better at a high level. Should I look at this as a single change that has to be taken in its entirety or not at all? Or, are each of the above targeted changes things that you could argue for independently, such that we could break this down and discuss each in turn?\n**Response:** The display-based proposal vocabulary is designed to be logical and allows layering. We think that they work well together as a set. For example, the \u201cexact text match\u201d preference can co-exist with a \u201cdisplay text length\u201d preference which will limit the number of words that are matched to the length indicated. We believe that we truly are being responsive to the larger community. Once people spend time to understand what we are proposing, I think it will be a lot easier. As you point out below \u2013 we are open to a discussion on what kind of breakdown may make sense without losing the engineering integrity of what we are proposing. \n\n> Obviously, breaking things down might make organizing discussion easier, but that only makes sense if there isn't an overarching principle that might motivate making all the changes together. It seems like you are seeking to articulate a principle at a higher level, but I'm struggling to grasp it. I don't know if that is what you are getting at with the concept of \"display-based preferences\", which I admit I had a lot of trouble with. Maybe it's a search thing I should be familiar with, but missed. Is there a framing you would use for the current drafts that I could use as a point of comparison that would help me better contrast the approaches? Or something else that might help me internalize this \"display-based preference\" concept?\n**Response:** The current draft really attempts to be a very broad vehicle covering every possible scenario. This is its critical flaw. Instead, we are much narrowly focused on bypassing a long-winded debate about terms like \u201cAutomated Processing\u201d and instead focus on a solution that has longevity and addresses the point at which an output is generated. We view ai-preferences as a true enablement mechanism that can be easily understood by all and build on extant practices.  We are happy to help build illustrative examples and/or work with you to craft a narrative to move the draft forward. \n\n",

This gap renders the proposal incomplete but also potentially harmful to the interests of right holders who may be unable to specifically express a preference regarding the summarization/stylistic simulation of their content.  This category is an essential companion to the search category, given the broad adoption of summarization approaches by existing search engines as well most other LLMs.  \n\n**Issue Description**:\nExisting mechanisms for expressing preferences in the Vocabulary Document do not address concerns which\nhave been strongly articulated about the practice of using digital assets as input to AI models to generate outputs which substitute for or undermine the value of the original assets.  This gap leaves a broad group of stakeholders (including creators, journalists and publishers) without a means to express a preference for a type of use which is already having a material adverse impact on their rights.  Developers and deployers of AI systems are also left without a clear, standardized preference signal regarding such uses, which results in \"blunt\" approaches to gathering such content - exposing them to legal risk.  This proposal is for the addition of a category in the Vocabulary document to define a tailored preference category to address the specific need, improve visibility across the board and support continued broad access to information and content.\n\nThe use of digital assets for inferencing \"in real time\" is widespread as a means of improving the accuracy and contextual relevance of outputs, such as through the use of techniques such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).  The flipside of that value is that such outputs are inclined to substitute for or dilute the value of the original asset, which decreases user engagement with the original asset.  This harms revenue opportunities and undermines the ability of the owner or distributor of the original asset to connect directly with their intended audience.  For example, the use of journalistic material to create AI-generated summaries which have resulted in the substantial reduction of internet traffic to online publications.  In the longer term, this jeopardises the sustainability of those enterprises and the underlying incentives to create and publish such material.  To mitigate this, some are moving content behind paywalls and deploying other means of limiting open access - diminishing access to information and content.\n\nShould incentives to create diminish, AI innovation will also suffer as a result of less quality content on which to build a distribution funnel.  This would also undermine the sustainability and verifiability of news and information services relied upon by the public and government institutions.  Where the AI model or platform takes on the role of information gatekeeper and shaper, connections between the public and original sources can be severed (or warped), which undermines the ability and willingness of internet users to ensure what they are reading, hearing or watching matches the original source(s), allowing factual misrepresentations to propagate and go unchecked.\n\nCreators have also justifiably expressed the need for a preference that addresses the use of their assets to create derivative works \"in the style of\" such original assets.  Creators are harmed by the unfettered use of their works as inputs to AI Models to create outputs which dilute the market for their works, adopting distinctive elements and styles established by the creators themselves - which also harms their moral rights and interests to protect the integrity of their works and ensure attribution.\n\n  Insertion of new category:  **AI Substitutive Use Category** \n\n   The Act of using one or more assets as input to a trained AI/ML model\n   (as opposed to the training of the model) which results in an output\n   which incorporates, summarizes, aggregates or reproduces the assets,\n   including stylistic elements thereof; provided, however that this\n   category does not cover the use of a lawfully acquired digital asset\n   where carried out directly by an end user (as opposed to a search\n   application or bot) as input to a trained model to create a summary\n   of such digital asset.\n\n   The use of assets for AI Substitutive Use is a proper subset of\n   Automated Processing usage [AIPREF-VOCAB].\n\n   This category is distinct from AI Training or Generative AI Training,\n   as it addresses uses that occur after a model has been trained,\n   during inference.  It is also distinct from Search, which covers uses\n   that direct users back to the original asset.  Substitutive Use, by\n   contrast, describes outputs that replace, reduce the utility of, or\n   make the source asset redundant to users by summarizing, reproducing,\n   or restyling its contents.\n\n   Consistent with that objective, this category would not apply where\n   end users are summarising digital assets which they have already\n   acquired, outside of the context of search or retrieving such assets\n   from online locations in summarized form.\n\n### Proposed Resolution\n\n_No response_",

This avoids situations where lack of preference leads to inaccessible or overwhelming outputs.\n\nIn my applied research (Dec\u00e0leg per a l\u2019atenci\u00f3 al p\u00fablic amb TEA, Cerdan-Chiscano, 2023, Diputaci\u00f3 de Barcelona & Aprenem Autisme), one of the key findings is that defaults matter: providing simple explanations, clear documents, and advance information is essential to avoid communication breakdown.\n\nI therefore recommend that the draft explicitly states that defaults should favour accessibility and usability, with cognitive accessibility as a key dimension.",

I\nhave some critiques of the specific categories but, more broadly, I\nthink this is tied to specific technology choices in a way that's\nunlikely to age well. I think instead it would be much more useful to\nfocus on the uses to which the data will be put (i.e., the output of the model),\nas that's really the source of unhappiness about these systems.\n\nJust so we're on the same page modern LLMs work (very approximately)\nby training on an enormous corpus of data which sets the model weights\n(I'm deliberately conflating pre-training and fine-tuning).  They are\nthen prompted with input and asked to create output based on that\ninput, as well as the output it's already generated (collectively the\ncontext). As part of that process, some models can also collect new\ndata and use that as part of the context (RAG). In the context of web\ncrawling, then we have two ways for data to get into the system:\n\n- In the training phase and stored in the model weights.\n- In the generation phase as part of the context via RAG.\n\nThis is an important technical distinction, but it's not clear why it\nmatters from the perspective of the site. Consider an AI system which\ncollects the same corpus as is currently used for pre-training but\nonly trains on a small portion of it and then when it's asked to\ngenerate content, uses some kind of \"internal RAG\" to suck in the\nrelevant documents and generate the output (this is a lot more like\nhuman brains seem to work in my experience, because we just can't\nremember much stuff). From the perspective of the site this is the\nsame: the system is using the site's content to generate new content,\nbut in the taxonomy of this draft, this isn't AI training or even\ngenerative AI training because it doesn't impact the model\nweights. Obviously I have no idea if this is a productive technical\ndirection, but neither do you, and conformance shouldn't hinge\non whether it turns out to be.\n\nIn my opinion a much more productive direction would be to focus on\nthe application to which this data is being put.  I don't have\nanything like a complete story, but it seems to me that we have some\nunderstanding of the categories at either end of the spectrum:\n\n- Indexing (search): where you attempt to determine which\n  piece of content the user wants and steer them towards it.\n\n- Substitution: where the service generates something that\n  is effectively a substitute good for the content.\n\nI think these are useful conceptually because the first is the\ntraditional one that I think people have generally accepted as \"good\"\nand the second is the one that seems to be of most concern. Obviously,\nit's not as clear as that because even before generative AI search\nsystems were producing substitute goods (infoboxes, etc.), but I think\nthat's a feature of this analysis, because sites often didn't like\nthat and I think this kind of taxonomy captures that intuition without\nworrying about whether the substitute good was generated via some\nLLM, deterministic hand-written code, or something in between.\n\nIn between these two, we have some other applications. For instance:\n\n- Summarization (think AI overviews) this is a partial substitute, but\n  often it comes with a source link which can steer traffic to the\n  site.\n\n- Generating original content that isn't a direct substitute.  An\n  example here might be code generation: the other day I asked an AI\n  to help write me a scraper for the IETF agenda [0] and while I'm\n  sure it was inspired by a lot of existing scraping scripts, it's not\n  like it plagiarized one of them in total or somehow reduced the\n  demand for them (this is a distinct question from whether it\n  injected some verbatim code).\n\nAgain, I don't claim that these are the right dividing lines, but I\nthink that this kind of analysis does a better job of capturing what\nis actually concerning to sites about AI. The challenge then becomes\nhow to turn these into relatively precise definitions. This is\nprobably harder than the current definitions, but I don't think\nprecision is a virtue if the definitions aren't actually a good fit to\nthe problem they are trying to solve (as they say, \"for every complex\nproblem there is an answer that is clear, simple, and wrong\").\n\n### Proposed Resolution\n\n_No response_",

I have a suggestion below that echoes back to Lila\u2019s original note about historic, widespread use of certain tools.

Historically, entities engaged in automated processing of digital assets in support of safety, education, scholarship, research, preservation, interoperability, accessibility, and other priorities have needed to make such choices in response to existing preference signaling mechanisms, and affected parties have had to grapple with the consequences. The preference statements described in this specification are no different.\n\n",

For example, in the WebBotAuthN Working Group, the term \u201cbots\u201d is  used to refer to \u201cnon-browser clients.\u201d By using the term \u201cbots\u201d in Section 6.1, it creates an inconsistent approach that will lead to confusion about the meaning of the preference. Some people may incorrectly believe that bots=n is a preference to disallow access by bots. Others may incorrectly believe bots=n is a preference to disallow all use by bots, regardless of whether that use is for or related to AI. \n\nThis is especially important because the Vocab and Attach documents are not intended to be read together all the time.  The Vocab is intended to also be a standalone document. As I understand it, members of this group are liaising with other standards bodies to export the final language from this document to other bodies for their use independently, without the structure of the Attach document or robots.txt.  See, for example, Leonard\u2019s recent email stating: <<This vocab is designed to be used in any scenario - online or offline, web or otherwise - where someone wishes to express a preference about the AI usage of an asset.>>   Earlier drafts also called for the Vocabulary to \u201cstandardize building blocks\u201d that could be used regardless of the manner of attachment. \n\nWhen the categories and descriptions in the Vocab document are considered as standalone expressions, it is even more important that their scope and intent is clear.\n\nProposal: delete the top category and the accompanying \u201cbots\u201d descriptor in 6.1.  This removes the ambiguity and confusion, maintaining the focus on AI and moving the group more toward consensus.\n\n See also PKeller reply 9/14 agreeing that the term \"clearly also problematic\" and suggesting focusing first on the automated processing category (which makes sense).\n\n### Proposed Resolution\n\n_No response_",

I will follow up with a nit on the details, but that doesn't diminish the value of the feedback:\n\n> This raises the question of whether the vocabulary is only meant to be used to express preferences about usage and not initial access regardless of the attachment mechanism. The very first sentence of the vocab doc uses the ambiguous term \u201cprocessing\u201d while most of the rest of the doc uses \u201cusage.\u201d If the intent is to define a vocabulary that only expresses preferences about an asset after the asset has been obtained (by whatever means), it needs an explicit scoping limitation to that effect. And then every attachment mechanism that gets defined in the IETF or elsewhere needs to reflect that.\n>\n> Making this distinction explicit might be a simple resolution to some of the concerns that have been raised about the automated processing category, because it would make clear that it\u2019s unnecessary to resolve the question of whether crawling/accessing a site is itself considered automated processing. No preferences are being expressed about access, other than insofar as sites would expect crawlers not to crawl their site if the site wishes to disallow all the uses of interest to the crawler. It would not resolve the concerns about behavior habituation and misinterpretation, though.\n>\n> Even with this distinction made explicit, there would still be the possibility of basically nonsensical use cases, e.g.:\n>\n> ```http\n> User-Agent: *\n> Content-Usage: /foo bots=n\n> ```\n> \n> Like what is the point of allowing crawling/access but then disallowing all usage? Maybe there is a use case I\u2019m missing.\n>\n> Note also that it may be entirely unrealistic to say that everywhere an attachment mechanism is specified, it has to preserve this distinction between access and usage. It\u2019s not like we can constrain mechanisms that get defined elsewhere.\n> \n> I\u2019ve never really been convinced of the need for the top-level category, but if we are going to have one we need to be clear about when it applies, and clarifying that it only applies after an asset has been obtained might help mitigate concerns about its breadth.\n\n### Proposed Resolution\n\nThere was some effort to make this distinction in editing, but it's clear that we need to be much clearer about it throughout.",

RFC 9309 is not clear when it comes to delineating groups, particularly when it comes to extensions like this one.  That means that a group with no Allow or Disallow lines might be joined to the next group.  That is, this might be one or two groups:\n\n```\nUser-Agent: *\nContent-Usage: /foo bots=n\nUser-Agent: bar\nContent-Usage: /foo bots=y\n```\n\nThe more substantive point is with respect to this:\n\n> Like what is the point of allowing crawling/access but then disallowing all usage? Maybe there is a use case I\u2019m missing.\n\nAs we have discussed at some length, these are preferences and so crawled content that has an associated preference that it not be used for any purpose is still available for use in cases where there is a reason to ignore preferences.\n\n> Note also that it may be entirely unrealistic to say that everywhere an attachment mechanism is specified, it has to preserve this distinction between access and usage. It\u2019s not like we can constrain mechanisms that get defined elsewhere.\n\nI don't think that this is unrealistic.  Getting the bits and using them are distinct actions.  Consider where the preferences are carried in an HTTP header.  It's not like the response isn't delivered and available, even if the preferences indicate that the reason for making the request goes against the stated preferences.  This distinction recognizes that there are still cases where the use motivates (or justifies) ignoring the preference.",

For example, the content of a PUT request that is used to answer subsequent GET requests. Note that servers that have not been updated to understand this field will not comply with this requirement.\n\nI think having the server retain the preference metadata is a great idea, but making it a \"MUST\" for any server which implements usage preferences is too restrictive. I believe servers should be allowed (and encouraged) to include this metadata header even if they don't have the means to implement state persistence based on request headers. Servers might implement alternative or more ergonomic mechanisms for expressing preferences, for instance via an HTML form field, and that is fine.\n\n### Proposed Resolution\n\nMake it \"MAY\".\n\nOverall I think this should be more of a recommendation or best practice.

While we recognize these outcomes are not the intent, the risk remains that critical functionality may be impaired, user expectations misaligned, and implementers exposed to complaints\u2014especially in regulated contexts. \n\nIt\u2019s also worth noting that existing mechanisms already allow publishers to signal bot access preferences. If there are concerns about their adoption or effectiveness, that may be a more productive area for discussion\u2014one we haven\u2019t yet seen raised in this group. \n\n### Proposed Resolution\n\nRemove the automated processing category.

In practice, preferences can be expressed directly on each activity, so the hierarchy does not add clarity; instead it forces artificial nesting. Real-world processing often overlaps across categories, and the hierarchy has already led to a patchwork of overlapping or conflicting proposals. Because publishers simply want to state \u201callow\u201d or \u201cdisallow\u201d for specific uses or use multiple preferences, the extra layer of hierarchy is unnecessary and risks confusing both implementers and publishers. A flatter, modular vocabulary would make preferences easier to understand, more consistent to apply, and better aligned with real systems. \n\n### Proposed Resolution\n\nRemove the heirarchical structure and replace with a flatter, modular structure that would make the preferences easier to understand, more consistent to apply, and better aligned with real systems.

Yet, many challenges arise when attempting to strike a durable definition: \n\nThe line between search and AI is increasingly blurred, making it hard to separate them meaningfully in policy. \n\nModern search relies on AI for functions like ranking and snippets, so a distinct \u201csearch\u201d opt-out may not be practical. \n\nThe current \u201csearch\u201d category appears to regulate internal system behavior in ways that are hard to define or audit. \n\nExisting mechanisms like robots.txt and noindex already give site owners strong control, so adding a new \u201csearch\u201d category could duplicate or conflict with these mechanisms. \n\n### Proposed Resolution\n\nWe have proposed alternate solution detailed here: [https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madhavan-aipref-displaybasedpref-01](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-madhavan-aipref-displaybasedpref-01 )",

Right now, these are pretty short, but we'll need to say more.  I've not modified text much, but I've added notes about AI and GenAI being subsets of the preceding categories.\r\n\r\nThere is also new text on what it means to receive more specific instructions.  The old text was not clear about the ways in which things might be made more specific.  I've expanded this to note the two ways:\r\n\r\n1. that the vocabulary might be expanded\r\n2. there might be more specific instructions in agreements between users of assets and other actors that override any general statement that is made\r\n\r\nThis latter point seems to be a continual point of confusion in discussions thus far, so I'm not claiming that this addresses those concerns yet.

It also fits neatly into the other formats we are considering.\r\n\r\nThere are some interesting implications that are worth highlighting. The text I've added goes into some of that in more detail, but just to list them for visibility:\r\n\r\n* This is a sequence of bytes, not a string.  That has implications for how it is included in some formats, but as RFC 9651 limits its syntax to a pretty small subset of the ASCII range, this is mostly just a theoretical consideration, not a practical one.\r\n\r\n* Parsing errors in RFC 9651 means that you lose everything.  No preference survives.  That means that authoring errors have consequences.  This is an artifact of the format being more of a computer-to-computer language, rather than being tolerant of human error.  I'm not thrilled with this, but recognize the trade-off involved.\r\n\r\n* Repeated keys mean that only the last one is taken.  Again, not thrilled with this, but think that the trade is tolerable.\r\n\r\n* Labels are lowercase only.  A lot of the list traffic has started to use \"AI=whatever\"; RFC 9651 doesn't let us shout.  I think that this is fine, but it's another minor ding.\r\n\r\n* Some patterns of use that might be natural are invalid.  For instance, spaces around the \"=\" is invalid, so \"ai = n\" would result in a parsing error and no preference being registered.\r\n\r\nCloses #8.",

      "body": "This pull request proposes to leave the definition of TDM unchanged, but removes the explicit reference that this is based on EU law. This is part based on a review of existing legal definitions of TDM in other jurisdictions that have TDM exceptions in ether copyright law: \r\n\r\nThe UK does not have a proper definition in the law itself, but the UK government provides on as part of its Guidance on Exceptions to copyright which is very similar to the EU definition: \r\n\r\n\"Text and data mining is the use of automated analytical techniques to analyse text and data for patterns, trends and other useful information.\"\r\n\r\nThe other two jurisdictions with TDM exceptions that I am aware of (Singapore and Japan) do not use the term TDM. Instead they anchor the exceptions on \u201ccomputational data analysis\u201d (SG) or \u201cdata analysis (JP). \r\n\r\nGiven this it seems sensible to keep the definition of TDM as unchanged.",

      "body": "This is stacked on top of #26.  It just shows the incremental change.  (If it is accepted and #26 is not, we'll lose it.  Be careful.)\r\n\r\nRather than describe how defaults apply as part of the processing algorithm, I've made that part of how the model is consulted.  This doesn't have any functional impact in this case; the result is the same either way.\r\n\r\nThe main decision this makes is about the order in which things apply:\r\n\r\n1. within a single statement, the most-specific statement applies (i.e., `genai` overrides `ai`)\r\n2. across multiple statements, the least-permissive statement of preference applies (i.e., `n` overrides `y`)\r\n\r\nWe'll need to discuss which model we want to follow and be deliberate about it.\r\n\r\nAn example should help.  Consider two statements of preference that include no preference for nested categories: `ai=n` and `genai=y`.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed approach, the more general answer from the first statement fills in an answer for the `genai` category.  That's the model that this change adopts.  The final, combined answer for `genai` is determined by the `ai=n` preference because the value from that statement is taken first and a disallow preference overrides an allow preference (absent other information; see the text).\r\n\r\nIn an alternative model, preferences could be combined before resolving any inherited preferences.  That is, items 1 and 2 above are swapped to:\r\n\r\n1. across multiple statements, the least permissive statement of preference for each category is selected\r\n2. then any category without an assigned preference inherits the preference of any less-specific category\r\n\r\nIn that case, we'd be saying that `ai=n` leaves `genai` unspecified deliberately to allow another preference to set `genai=y` if they prefer.  Only if no other entity expresses a preference, does the implied `genai=n` apply.  In that model, we'd be assuming that the entity that sets `ai=n` knows about `genai` and chooses to defer to others on what the preference is.\r\n\r\nI personally dislike the alternative.  It makes any vocabulary extension fraught with issues.  Consider that an extension we define later might carve out space for a new specialized usage (like `inference`, if we were to define that in three years time, or `commercial` or anything else we might defer).  That would put an unexpected hole in any established preference.  Anyone who previously said no to a class of usage could have that preference overridden for that specialized usage.\r\n\r\nStructuring the document this way allows us to make a decision between these a little more easily than if the \"processing\" in #26 filled in values for `genai` from the value of `ai`.\r\n\r\nFinally, the last decision in the change is that attachment mechanisms can define that one statement can override another.\r\n\r\nThat opens the possibility of us choosing to have the HTTP header override robots.txt or even having content metadata override any other preferences.  If we find that this isn't needed, that's fine, but I understand that this is still on the table.  Including it cost me little effort; removing it would be equally easy.",

Input on this would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nBasically, I'm conflicted on this.  Using Specification Required gives some flexibility for the process to recognize emerging labels without a lot of procedural overhead, but it seems like this is angling toward IETF Review as the operative policy.  Should we face facts and just go straight for IETF Review?  That would allow the advice to be a little more streamlined, because we'd be able to rely on the standards process to iron out the kinks.\r\n\r\nThere's also the option to pair IETF Review with IESG Approval, which means \"get an RFC\" or \"convince an IETF AD\".  That almost amounts to the same thing in practice (if you can convince an AD of something, one of those things is publishing an RFC.  Though the RFC still requires IETF consensus, so it's a somewhat higher bar, but only \"somewhat\" given how careful most ADs are).\r\n\r\nIn any case, this seemed like a reasonable starting point for a discussion, which is always easier when there is something concrete to discuss.",

Not a problem for these all-ASCII names, but it might end up being a problem later.\r\n\r\nI've also sorted the list (by first name, which is my preferred approach once we have to deal with people who put family names first and all that).\r\n\r\nThere are probably a few other people that we might add here, though I want to be clear about the level of contribution before doing that.

That is an important clarification, but I think we need to address that separately.  That is, we need to recognize that what we conceive of as \"search\" applications are more complicated than a simple index that is used to locate stuff.  We need commentary that explains that a single application can embody multiple usage categories and that use of assets for each of those aspects can have separate rules.  This isn't necessarily how those applications are built today[^1], but that's not necessarily a constraint on what we do.\r\n\r\n[^1]: I am reminded of the concept of a \"data lake\", which has no distinction about where data has come from, the purpose for which it was obtained, or anything along those lines, making compliance with data protection regulation impossible.  The analogy here is with respect to use of assets for multiple purposes, without distinction.  For data lakes, the introduction of things like GDPR helped application developers build discipline about how they obtain and label personal information; perhaps this requires a similar shift, albeit one that affects a smaller set of people.",

      "body": "This updates the draft text to make the path segment mandatory instead of optional. The motivation is to make the `Content-Usage` directive read more clearly like the `Allow`/`Disallow` directives, and generally make robots.txt files more legible and understandable to humans (whether they have prior experience with robots.txt or not). This should have almost no impact on actual behavior or what preferences can be expressed. The trade-off is that every line will have two additional bytes for the case of \"all paths\", and that seems like a reasonable trade off for legibility.\r\n\r\nA secondary benefit is that implementation becomes marginally easier: code will know there is always a leading path segment. While optional fields are common in protocols, it is more common to have trailing fields be optional, not leading fields. The current text *is* unambiguous about how to detect whether there is a path segment or not (if there is a leading `/` character), but this makes things just a bit easier to implement correctly.\r\n\r\nI think this would be an improvement on the syntax and it would be great to get it in. However, I do want to prioritize moving work forward, and think this improvement is not worth holding things up.",

This attempts to synthesize ideas from numerous sources, including various email threads on the mailing list, drafts shared (in particular\r\ndraft-madhavan-aipref-displaybasedpref) and some ideas that were floating around.\r\n\r\nThis concentrates on system outputs and aims to primarily address concerns about substitutive use.  That is, the potential for AI to generate content that is different from source material, but which might replace it.\r\n\r\nWe did not include some of the concepts that were in draft-madhavan-aipref-displaybasedpref about limiting output size and so forth, but recognize that those might make good extensions at a later time.  Those will depend on specific formats (text lengths for text, snippet duration for audio or video, etc..) and we concluded that we want to concentrate on the core concept.\r\n\r\nThis is a less flexible version of the thing that was presented.  Rather than having separate conditions of use attached to a permission grant, one for linking back and another for requiring direct quoting rather than paraphrasing or summarizing.  These too might need further refinement in future.  For example, we talked about how certain formats might be able to identify which content (text, time, whatever) is OK to quote and which is not.\r\n\r\nThis does not attempt to address the new problem this raises, which is that indicating that you would like these new categories to be allowed in practice also means that you need to say the same for AI training. That's not a problem this is attempting to solve.  We'll need to do that in some other way.",
