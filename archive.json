If we resolve that, then the logical thing to do is ensure that only the most-specific preference applies.\n\nSetting that aside, we still need to resolve the question of how to resolve conflicting preferences for the same thing.  I heard that most restrictive was perhaps the safest approach, but there are some potential secondary information channels that might lead to weighting things differently.  For instance, an HTTP header field might be considered as an override for something in robots.txt rather than having both preferences apply.\n\nThings to consider also are the specificity associated with different channels.  If both HTTP header field and robots.txt apply and we go with most specific, most restrictive (in that order) then a more specific \"allow\" statement in robots.txt would override a less specific \"deny\" statement in the header field.  That might be surprising to the entity specifying the \"deny\" preference.  Either is potentially acceptable, but we need to be very clear about what the properties of the system are, especially for cases like this.",

If content is delivered over HTTP, then we have either robots.txt or headers that can only describe preferences for resources or representations.  If something is comprised of multiple components, those will be unable to target specific components unless they are exposed as discrete HTTP resources.\n\nIf this use case is important to you, then I'd suggest that you need to define a more complex attachment method specific to the media container.  None of the attachment methods we've talked about thus far are capable of that sort of finer-grained targeting.",

Typically these will be an expression of different preferences for Video than for Audio, especially when the audio element may consist of spoken words and of music.",
