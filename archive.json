If we resolve that, then the logical thing to do is ensure that only the most-specific preference applies.\n\nSetting that aside, we still need to resolve the question of how to resolve conflicting preferences for the same thing.  I heard that most restrictive was perhaps the safest approach, but there are some potential secondary information channels that might lead to weighting things differently.  For instance, an HTTP header field might be considered as an override for something in robots.txt rather than having both preferences apply.\n\nThings to consider also are the specificity associated with different channels.  If both HTTP header field and robots.txt apply and we go with most specific, most restrictive (in that order) then a more specific \"allow\" statement in robots.txt would override a less specific \"deny\" statement in the header field.  That might be surprising to the entity specifying the \"deny\" preference.  Either is potentially acceptable, but we need to be very clear about what the properties of the system are, especially for cases like this.",

If content is delivered over HTTP, then we have either robots.txt or headers that can only describe preferences for resources or representations.

Typically these will be an expression of different preferences for Video than for Audio, especially when the audio element may consist of spoken words and of music.",

For instance, on-list discussion seems to be moving toward the idea of having an IANA registry for the vocabulary.  If that holds, we'll need to add something for that.\n\nThen there are extensions that are not limited to the vocabulary.  If we go with #26, that might be non-vocabulary dictionary keys or parameters on those keys (which might be specific to different vocabulary terms).\n\nMy proposal is to define clearly how to extend the vocabulary and define an IANA registry for that.  But leave other forms of extension open in a way that would require a fresh RFC to define.\n\nI would suggest that the vocabulary registry operate on a fairly strict regime, not because of a scarcity of space, but to signal that we think that new categories should be discouraged generally.  We can't completely cut that off: experience with registries shows that if you are too strict, people don't bother with registration, instead they just use whatever codepoints they like without any coordination.  Such things lead to interoperability failure and can make things very unhealthy.  I'd probably suggest that we pick one of the [RFC 8126](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8126#section-4) options that looks permissive, but add instructions that strongly discourage registration in practice.  I like [Specification Required](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8126#section-4.6) for that sort of thing.",

It also fits neatly into the other formats we are considering.\r\n\r\nThere are some interesting implications that are worth highlighting. The text I've added goes into some of that in more detail, but just to list them for visibility:\r\n\r\n* This is a sequence of bytes, not a string.  That has implications for how it is included in some formats, but as RFC 9651 limits its syntax to a pretty small subset of the ASCII range, this is mostly just a theoretical consideration, not a practical one.\r\n\r\n* Parsing errors in RFC 9651 means that you lose everything.  No preference survives.  That means that authoring errors have consequences.  This is an artifact of the format being more of a computer-to-computer language, rather than being tolerant of human error.  I'm not thrilled with this, but recognize the trade-off involved.\r\n\r\n* Repeated keys mean that only the last one is taken.  Again, not thrilled with this, but think that the trade is tolerable.\r\n\r\n* Labels are lowercase only.  A lot of the list traffic has started to use \"AI=whatever\"; RFC 9651 doesn't let us shout.  I think that this is fine, but it's another minor ding.\r\n\r\n* Some patterns of use that might be natural are invalid.  For instance, spaces around the \"=\" is invalid, so \"ai = n\" would result in a parsing error and no preference being registered.\r\n\r\nCloses #8.",

This looks good to me (with the caveat, that I am not really in a position to evaluates the merits of the proposal versus other ways of doing this, but it seems fit for purpose). \r\n\r\nOne thing I was wondering after reading this, is how the hierarchy between categories is dealt with. based on what we have tdm=n also means ai=n and genai=n without the latter two having to be explicitly declared. wouldn't that be something that also needs to be addressed by the proposed processing algorithm?

You might use parameters to communicate things that search engines respect, like how large a snippet can be taken of content: `search=y;max-snippet=100`  (In whatever unit we agree.)

      "body": "This is stacked on top of #26.  It just shows the incremental change.  (If it is accepted and #26 is not, we'll lose it.  Be careful.)\r\n\r\nRather than describe how defaults apply as part of the processing algorithm, I've made that part of how the model is consulted.  This doesn't have any functional impact in this case; the result is the same either way.\r\n\r\nThe main decision this makes is about the order in which things apply:\r\n\r\n1. within a single statement, the most-specific statement applies (i.e., `genai` overrides `ai`)\r\n2. across multiple statements, the least-permissive statement of preference applies (i.e., `n` overrides `y`)\r\n\r\nWe'll need to discuss which model we want to follow and be deliberate about it.\r\n\r\nAn example should help.  Consider two statements of preference that include no preference for nested categories: `ai=n` and `genai=y`.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed approach, the more general answer from the first statement fills in an answer for the `genai` category.  That's the model that this change adopts.  The final, combined answer for `genai` is determined by the `ai=n` preference because the value from that statement is taken first and a disallow preference overrides an allow preference (absent other information; see the text).\r\n\r\nIn an alternative model, preferences could be combined before resolving any inherited preferences.  That is, items 1 and 2 above are swapped to:\r\n\r\n1. across multiple statements, the least permissive statement of preference for each category is selected\r\n2. then any category without an assigned preference inherits the preference of any less-specific category\r\n\r\nIn that case, we'd be saying that `ai=n` leaves `genai` unspecified deliberately to allow another preference to set `genai=y` if they prefer.  Only if no other entity expresses a preference, does the implied `genai=n` apply.  In that model, we'd be assuming that the entity that sets `ai=n` knows about `genai` and chooses to defer to others on what the preference is.\r\n\r\nI personally dislike the alternative.  It makes any vocabulary extension fraught with issues.  Consider that an extension we define later might carve out space for a new specialized usage (like `inference`, if we were to define that in three years time, or `commercial` or anything else we might defer).  That would put an unexpected hole in any established preference.  Anyone who previously said no to a class of usage could have that preference overridden for that specialized usage.\r\n\r\nStructuring the document this way allows us to make a decision between these a little more easily than if the \"processing\" in #26 filled in values for `genai` from the value of `ai`.\r\n\r\nFinally, the last decision in the change is that attachment mechanisms can define that one statement can override another.\r\n\r\nThat opens the possibility of us choosing to have the HTTP header override robots.txt or even having content metadata override any other preferences.  If we find that this isn't needed, that's fine, but I understand that this is still on the table.  Including it cost me little effort; removing it would be equally easy.",
