For instance, taking written text and asking for a summary.\n\nSomething @lrosenthol said during the meeting seemed right to me.  We can have the definition include prohibitions (or reservations, or the opposite) for inferences of all those types, but then leave the question as to whether different parts of the system respect that to the people who are building those elements.  And their lawyers.\n\nOne possible response is to respect opt-outs and refuse to process inputs.  For instance, it could be that copying of style is not something that a particular product wants to be associated with.\n\nAnother approach is to ask the user of the system to accept the responsibility for contravening expressed preferences.  That might manifest in a number of ways from implicit/invisible (terms of service that make users responsible for respecting preferences for the content they source) to very prominent (an active prompt when using content that has preferences not to allow inference that forces users to accept that).\n\nRAG systems where automated systems seek out and ingest content probably have a different set of constraints on what they can or cannot do.  Still, the suite of options available for people building those products are still roughly along the same lines.\n\nEither way, this is not necessarily something that we have to decide here.  It's worth understanding, for sure, so that we are sure that the set of possibilities we enable are acceptable.  I am personally comfortable with that.",

Under the EU AI Act, AI model developers will mostly demonstrate compliance by signing up to a Code of Practice, which is currently being finalized. The latest draft version of the Code of Practice requires AI developers to: \r\n\r\n\"(a) employ web-crawlers that read and follow instructions expressed in accordance with the\r\nRobot Exclusion Protocol (robots.txt), as specified in the Internet Engineering Task Force\r\n(IETF) Request for Comments No. 9309, and any subsequent version of this IETF standard,\r\nand\r\n(b) make best efforts to identify and comply with other appropriate machine-readable protocols\r\nto express rights reservations pursuant to Article 4(3) of Directive (EU) 2019/790, for\r\nexample through asset-based or location-based metadata\u201c\r\n\r\nIn other words, while the preference signals are voluntary, they may very well end up having a quasi-mandatory effect on AI developers through the AI Act Code of Practice. Users won\u2019t have the option to simply switch to another provider if the vocabulary requires AI companies that want to \u201eread and follow\u201c or \u201eidentify and comply with\" the preference signals to restrict actions of their users that are perfectly legal under copyright law.\r\n\r\nThat\u2019s why it is very important, if we don\u2019t want the preference signals to inadvertently become a mechanism for technologically depriving end users of their rights under copyright law (such as the right to private copying, parody etc.), the vocabulary has to define the actions of end users interacting with AI tools as out of scope.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nFelix\r\n\r\n> Am 25.06.2025 um 12:23 schrieb Paul Keller ***@***.***>:\r\n> \r\n> To me, it is pretty clear that at this stage, we have two lines of argument related to the question of how we can prevent preferences about inference from impacting individual users\u2019 rights, that we will need to resolve at some point (in London, I assume).\r\n> \r\n> The first one goes for a broad definition of inference (use of an asset as input for a trained model) and assumes that the protection of users\u2019 rights can best be left to implementers / the market (if a tool interprets preference signals very restrictively, then just use another tool that does not).

The example about the Code of Practice indicates that governments (not this group) can and will do whatever they want to shape rules which govern the use of content - and I think it is in those forums that these discussions should happen to address concerns about how far those rules go.

I'll take as examples the request for an image description or the simplification of a complex paragraph for somebody with an intellectual disability. \n\nIt is true that in this first variant, a user providing a document to an AI system and prompting \"copy it with a few differences\" is going against the will of the content owner. However, I imagine that anti-parasitism and anti-counterfeit laws would apply if he publicly releases the results of this process. \n\nI'm therefore not comfortable with an AI preference that can easily clash with accessibility requirements (especially if some system developers poorly understand the nuance). \n\nIn the second variant, the content possibly flagged with an opt-out is provided by the system as part of the RESPONSE offered by the AI system. This is typically the RAG case, where fresh content is combined with a trained model to improve the response. The AI system is responsible for the content it selects, there is no clash with pro-accessibility laws, and the AI preferences are therefore easy to apply. \n\nNobody knows how long the term RAG will survive before a new method appears.

I heard that most restrictive was perhaps the safest approach, but there are some potential secondary information channels that might lead to weighting things differently.  For instance, an HTTP header field might be considered as an override for something in robots.txt rather than having both preferences apply.\n\nThings to consider also are the specificity associated with different channels.  If both HTTP header field and robots.txt apply and we go with most specific, most restrictive (in that order) then a more specific \"allow\" statement in robots.txt would override a less specific \"deny\" statement in the header field.  That might be surprising to the entity specifying the \"deny\" preference.

A *thing* that is reproduced from an original (a digital scan of the Mona Lisa, say) is no different from an image that was wholly digital at its inception.  The subject of the preference is the sequence of bits, maybe with its metadata.\n\nI don't agree with Leonard that \"artifact\" implies secondary.  From my visits to museums, the use of the word in that context seems pretty clearly applicable to primary instances.  But then, perhaps all digital things being secondary is something we can embrace, rather than consider to be a failing of sorts.  That there can be no \"primary\" instance is a delightful idea to me.\n\n> the ATTACH draft already uses it in the title\n\nI would not consider that as a reason to use \"Content\".  Though I do regard it positively, despite the negative connotations.  To Paul's point, In my industry \"user\" has negative connotations as it can have a dehumanizing impact; it's still a term of art though.

For instance, on-list discussion seems to be moving toward the idea of having an IANA registry for the vocabulary.  If that holds, we'll need to add something for that.\n\nThen there are extensions that are not limited to the vocabulary.  If we go with #26, that might be non-vocabulary dictionary keys or parameters on those keys (which might be specific to different vocabulary terms).\n\nMy proposal is to define clearly how to extend the vocabulary and define an IANA registry for that.  But leave other forms of extension open in a way that would require a fresh RFC to define.\n\nI would suggest that the vocabulary registry operate on a fairly strict regime, not because of a scarcity of space, but to signal that we think that new categories should be discouraged generally.  We can't completely cut that off: experience with registries shows that if you are too strict, people don't bother with registration, instead they just use whatever codepoints they like without any coordination.  Such things lead to interoperability failure and can make things very unhealthy.  I'd probably suggest that we pick one of the [RFC 8126](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8126#section-4) options that looks permissive, but add instructions that strongly discourage registration in practice.

I think that this is entirely deliberate: we decided to look at the outcome of the application, not so much how it is implemented.  As our friends in search are happy to remind us: search _is_ an AI application, so attempting to distinguish between \"search\" and \"AI search\" is essentially meaningless.

The ask is that you have a look at that file, understand if you like or not what you have, open the discussion if you need to make a diverged definition of AI (all definitions are about context) and make a conscious act, and reference in bibliography the document.\n\nAdditionally you could look at the glossary and see if there are other terms that are interested for you.\n\nMy point is simply to HELP so that you don't need to do this research and can select what you need. and if you need to redefine something then good but please in this case inform JCA-AIML that you redefine it for a good reason so it is a conscious act and not a random decision, acknowledging the work that is being done in other fora by a gazillion of other colleagues who are all committed on standardisation.\n\nhope it clarifies. \n\nWill anyway subscribe to the mailing list and check if/how I can share the glossary file to respect the IETF normal process.\n\nHope it helps",

      "body": "This is related to #98 but I think it warrants a separate discussion beyond refining the definition, since having a carve-out for one category may be problematic. It's possible this was discussed at the meetings and I'm missing some context, but it seems like carving out \"Search\" will have an inevitable effect of applications contorting themselves to be Search-oriented for the likely outcome of more permissive preferences.\n\nFor example, suppose a content owner does not want to be de-listed from all modern search the utilizes AI for the \"core search\" technology. They do not however want to consent to say, a chatbot-like application which is going to perform a \"deep research\" style feature that produces an extended report with a citation to the source. The existing definition carve out simply says:\n\n> Using one or more assets in a search application that directs users to the location from which the assets were retrieved.\n\nIt is pretty easy to suggest any linking to the original content \"directs the user to the location\". This can go beyond text too, for example, suppose a hypothetical product which produces a short form video or podcast based on a research topic. As part of the media output, it produces URLs linking to the source material. The application can claim this is \"directing the user to that location\".\n\nI'm not sure there's any viable way around this beyond getting more specific about the particular application experiences, or, alternatively, not having carve-outs at all. If the former, there likely needs to be more specific taxonomy for application use cases, that likely evolve over time.",

The text I've added goes into some of that in more detail, but just to list them for visibility:\r\n\r\n* This is a sequence of bytes, not a string.  That has implications for how it is included in some formats, but as RFC 9651 limits its syntax to a pretty small subset of the ASCII range, this is mostly just a theoretical consideration, not a practical one.\r\n\r\n* Parsing errors in RFC 9651 means that you lose everything.  No preference survives.  That means that authoring errors have consequences.  This is an artifact of the format being more of a computer-to-computer language, rather than being tolerant of human error.  I'm not thrilled with this, but recognize the trade-off involved.\r\n\r\n* Repeated keys mean that only the last one is taken.  Again, not thrilled with this, but think that the trade is tolerable.\r\n\r\n* Labels are lowercase only.  A lot of the list traffic has started to use \"AI=whatever\"; RFC 9651 doesn't let us shout.  I think that this is fine, but it's another minor ding.\r\n\r\n* Some patterns of use that might be natural are invalid.  For instance, spaces around the \"=\" is invalid, so \"ai = n\" would result in a parsing error and no preference being registered.\r\n\r\nCloses #8.",

      "body": "This is stacked on top of #26.  It just shows the incremental change.  (If it is accepted and #26 is not, we'll lose it.  Be careful.)\r\n\r\nRather than describe how defaults apply as part of the processing algorithm, I've made that part of how the model is consulted.  This doesn't have any functional impact in this case; the result is the same either way.\r\n\r\nThe main decision this makes is about the order in which things apply:\r\n\r\n1. within a single statement, the most-specific statement applies (i.e., `genai` overrides `ai`)\r\n2. across multiple statements, the least-permissive statement of preference applies (i.e., `n` overrides `y`)\r\n\r\nWe'll need to discuss which model we want to follow and be deliberate about it.\r\n\r\nAn example should help.  Consider two statements of preference that include no preference for nested categories: `ai=n` and `genai=y`.\r\n\r\nIn the proposed approach, the more general answer from the first statement fills in an answer for the `genai` category.  That's the model that this change adopts.  The final, combined answer for `genai` is determined by the `ai=n` preference because the value from that statement is taken first and a disallow preference overrides an allow preference (absent other information; see the text).\r\n\r\nIn an alternative model, preferences could be combined before resolving any inherited preferences.  That is, items 1 and 2 above are swapped to:\r\n\r\n1. across multiple statements, the least permissive statement of preference for each category is selected\r\n2. then any category without an assigned preference inherits the preference of any less-specific category\r\n\r\nIn that case, we'd be saying that `ai=n` leaves `genai` unspecified deliberately to allow another preference to set `genai=y` if they prefer.  Only if no other entity expresses a preference, does the implied `genai=n` apply.  In that model, we'd be assuming that the entity that sets `ai=n` knows about `genai` and chooses to defer to others on what the preference is.\r\n\r\nI personally dislike the alternative.  It makes any vocabulary extension fraught with issues.  Consider that an extension we define later might carve out space for a new specialized usage (like `inference`, if we were to define that in three years time, or `commercial` or anything else we might defer).  That would put an unexpected hole in any established preference.  Anyone who previously said no to a class of usage could have that preference overridden for that specialized usage.\r\n\r\nStructuring the document this way allows us to make a decision between these a little more easily than if the \"processing\" in #26 filled in values for `genai` from the value of `ai`.\r\n\r\nFinally, the last decision in the change is that attachment mechanisms can define that one statement can override another.\r\n\r\nThat opens the possibility of us choosing to have the HTTP header override robots.txt or even having content metadata override any other preferences.  If we find that this isn't needed, that's fine, but I understand that this is still on the table.  Including it cost me little effort; removing it would be equally easy.",

      "body": "(Again, this is based on #26; merge this and nothing happens unless you also merge #26.)\r\n\r\nThis enacts the suggested approach for vocabulary extensions I described in #38.\r\n\r\nStill, this was particularly tricky to get the wording even remotely in the space I wanted and I'm not sure whether I got there.  Input on this would be appreciated.\r\n\r\nBasically, I'm conflicted on this.  Using Specification Required gives some flexibility for the process to recognize emerging labels without a lot of procedural overhead, but it seems like this is angling toward IETF Review as the operative policy.  Should we face facts and just go straight for IETF Review?  That would allow the advice to be a little more streamlined, because we'd be able to rely on the standards process to iron out the kinks.\r\n\r\nThere's also the option to pair IETF Review with IESG Approval, which means \"get an RFC\" or \"convince an IETF AD\".  That almost amounts to the same thing in practice (if you can convince an AD of something, one of those things is publishing an RFC.  Though the RFC still requires IETF consensus, so it's a somewhat higher bar, but only \"somewhat\" given how careful most ADs are).\r\n\r\nIn any case, this seemed like a reasonable starting point for a discussion, which is always easier when there is something concrete to discuss.",

That is an important clarification, but I think we need to address that separately.  That is, we need to recognize that what we conceive of as \"search\" applications are more complicated than a simple index that is used to locate stuff.  We need commentary that explains that a single application can embody multiple usage categories and that use of assets for each of those aspects can have separate rules.  This isn't necessarily how those applications are built today[^1], but that's not necessarily a constraint on what we do.\r\n\r\n[^1]: I am reminded of the concept of a \"data lake\", which has no distinction about where data has come from, the purpose for which it was obtained, or anything along those lines, making compliance with data protection regulation impossible.  The analogy here is with respect to use of assets for multiple purposes, without distinction.  For data lakes, the introduction of things like GDPR helped application developers build discipline about how they obtain and label personal information; perhaps this requires a similar shift, albeit one that affects a smaller set of people.",

      "body": "This updates the draft text to make the path segment mandatory instead of optional. The motivation is to make the `Content-Usage` directive read more clearly like the `Allow`/`Disallow` directives, and generally make robots.txt files more legible and understandable to humans (whether they have prior experience with robots.txt or not). This should have almost no impact on actual behavior or what preferences can be expressed. The trade-off is that every line will have two additional bytes for the case of \"all paths\", and that seems like a reasonable trade off for legibility.\r\n\r\nA secondary benefit is that implementation becomes marginally easier: code will know there is always a leading path segment. While optional fields are common in protocols, it is more common to have trailing fields be optional, not leading fields. The current text *is* unambiguous about how to detect whether there is a path segment or not (if there is a leading `/` character), but this makes things just a bit easier to implement correctly.\r\n\r\nI think this would be an improvement on the syntax and it would be great to get it in. However, I do want to prioritize moving work forward, and think this improvement is not worth holding things up.",

Narrow the definition to cover those cases that drive traffic to the original location of assets.\r\n\r\n2. Ensure that this allows the use of AI in search applications, so that search preferences override AI use preferences.\r\n\r\n3. To ensure that AI overviews, which act as a substitute for visiting the site, are excluded.\r\n\r\nObviously, there will continue to be things on the line.  The draft has text addressing the question of ambiguity.  As has been noted, the law has far better tools for managing that than technical specifications... if there is a dispute, that is.",

The main change i am objecting here is that the new version (especially way the examples are phrased) quite substantially narrows the safeguards to cases explicitly recognized in law. This collapses the wider discretionary space acknowledged in the current draft\u2014where law, established practice, or societal values can justify overriding preferences\u2014into a much narrower one defined only by explicit legal permission.\r\n\r\nI have made another attempt here #119",
