            A Vocabulary For Expressing AI Usage Preferences
                     draft-ietf-aipref-vocab-latest

Abstract

   This document proposes a standardized vocabulary for expressing
   preferences related to how digital assets are used by automated
   processing systems.  This vocabulary allows for the creation of
   structured declarations about restrictions or permissions for use of
   digital assets by such systems.  The vocabulary is agnostic to the
   means by which it is conveyed.  The definitions in the vocabulary
   facilitate a shared understanding between entities that express such
   preferences and those that use the associated digital assets.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a common vocabulary of terms for automated
   systems that process digital assets.  The primary purpose of this
   vocabulary is to enable machine-readable expressions of preferences
   about how digital assets are used by automated processing systems, in
   the context of training AI models and other forms of text and data
   mining (TDM).

   The terms defined by the vocabulary can be used to describe, in a
   standardized way, the types of uses that a declaring party may wish
   to explicitly restrict or allow.  Preferences are then expressed as a
   grant or denial of permission concerning each of the types of use
   defined in the vocabulary.  This ensures that preferences can be
   communicated, processed, and stored in a consistent and interoperable
   manner.

   The vocabulary is neutral to the technical details of how systems act
   on preferences.  It is designed to ensure that preference information
   can be exchanged between different systems and consistently
   understood.

   The vocabulary is intended to govern the use of digital assets for
   the training of AI models and other forms of automated processing.
   It does not concern itself with the mechanisms involved in obtaining
   digital assets (i.e., crawling).

   The vocabulary is intended to work in contexts where such preferences
   result in legal obligations (such as rights reservations made by
   rightholders in jurisdictions with conditional TDM exceptions), and
   in contexts where this is not the case.  It is without prejudice to
   applicable laws and the applicability of exceptions and limitations
   to copyright.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document uses the following terms:

   Asset:
      A digital file or stream of data, usually with associated
      metadata.
   Declaring party:
      The entity that expresses a preference with regards to an Asset.

3.  Statements of Preference

   The vocabulary is a set of categories, each of which is defined to
   cover a class of usage for assets.  Section 4 defines these
   categories in more detail.

   A statement of preference is made about an asset.  Statements of
   preferences can assign preferences to each of the categories of use
   in the vocabulary.  Preferences regarding each category can be
   expressed either to allow or disallow the usage associated with the
   category.

   A statement of preferences can express preferences about some, all,
   or none of the categories from the vocabulary.  This can mean that no
   preference is expressed for a given usage category.

   Some categories describe a proper subset of the usages of other
   categories.  A preference that is expressed for the more general
   category applies if no preference is expressed for the more specific
   category.

   For example, the TDM category might be assigned a preference that
   allows the associated usage.  In the absence of any statement of
   preference regarding the AI Training category, that usage would be
   also be allowed, as AI Training is a subset of the TDM category.  In
   comparison, an explicit preference regarding AI Training might
   disallow that usage, while permitting other usage within the TDM
   category.

   After processing a statement of preferences the recipient can assume
   that each category of use has a preference in one of three states:
   "allowed", "disallowed", or "unknown".

4.  Vocabulary Definition

   This section defines the categories of use in the vocabulary.

   Figure 1 shows the relationship between these categories:

    .-------------------------------------------------.
   |                                                   |
   |               Text and Data Mining                |
   |                                                   |
   |   .-------------------------------------------.   |
   |  |                .------------------------.   |  |
   |  |               |                          |  |  |
   |  |               |                          |  |  |
   |  |  AI Training  |  Generative AI Training  |  |  |
   |  |               |                          |  |  |
   |  |               |                          |  |  |
   |  |                '------------------------'   |  |
   |   '-------------------------------------------'   |
    '-------------------------------------------------'

              Figure 1: Relationship Between Categories of Use

   This list of specific use cases may be expanded in the future, should
   a consensus emerge between stakeholders, to include categories that
   address additional use cases as they emerge.  In addition to these
   categories defined in the vocabulary, it is also expected that some
   systems implementing this vocabulary may extend this list with
   additional categories for their particular needs.

4.1.  Text and Data Mining (TDM) Category

   The act of using one or more assets in the context of any automated
   analytical technique aimed at analyzing text and data in digital form
   in order to generate information which includes but is not limited to
   patterns, trends and correlations.

   The use of assets for TDM encompasses all the subsequent categories.

4.2.  AI Training Category

   The act of training machine learning models or artificial
   intelligence (AI).

   The use of assets for AI Training is a proper subset of TDM usage.

4.3.  Generative AI Training Category

   The act of training General Purpose AI models that have the capacity
   to generate text, images or other forms of synthetic content, or the
   act of training other types of AI models that have the purpose of
   generating text, images or other forms of synthetic content.

   The use of assets for Generative AI Training is a proper subset of AI
   Training usage.

4.4.  Search Category

   The act of using one or more assets to build a search index or as
   input to a trained AI/ML model that has the purpose of providing
   search results that include direct links to the location from where
   the asset was obtained.

4.5.  AI Inference Category

   The act of using one or more assets as input to a trained AI/ML model
   as part of the operation of that model (as opposed to the training of
   the model).

5.  Usage

   The vocabulary is used by referencing the terms defined in the
   Section 4 section above, directly or via mappings, in accordance with
   how they are defined in this document.

5.1.  More Specific Instructions

   A recipient of a statement of preferences that follows this model
   might receive more specific instructions in two ways:

   *  Extensions to the vocabulary might define more specific categories
      of usage.  Preferences about more specific categories override
      those of any more general category.

   *  Statements of preferences are general purpose, machine-readable
      statements that cannot override contractual agreements or more
      specific statements.

   For instance, a statement of preferences might indicate that the use
   of an asset is disallowed for AI Training.  If arrangements, such as
   contracts exist that explicitly permit the use of that asset, those
   arrangements likely apply, unless the terms of the arrangement
   explicitly say otherwise.

   The vocabulary does not preclude the use of other specific
   categories.  Any statement of preference based on this vocabulary
   shall not be interpreted as restricting the use of the work(s)
   strictly for the purpose of search and discovery as long as no
   restriction is declared through search-specific means such as
   [RFC9309].

5.2.  Vocabulary Extensions

   Systems referencing the vocabulary must not introduce additional
   categories that include existing categories defined in the vocabulary
   or otherwise include additional hierarchical relationships.

6.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
